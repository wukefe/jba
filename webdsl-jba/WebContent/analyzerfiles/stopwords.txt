# This is a stop word file that can be used by a StopFilter, like in the following example
#
# analyzer exampleUsingCustomStopwords{
#	tokenizer = StandardTokenizer
#	tokenfilter = StandardFilter
#	tokenfilter = LowerCaseFilter
#	tokenfilter = StopFilter (words="analyzerfiles/stopwords.txt")
# }
#
# Be aware that any change to an analyzer in use means that you need to reindex your data.
# See http://webdsl.org/selectpage/Manual/Search for more info on re(indexing).
# 
# Use one line for each stopword
